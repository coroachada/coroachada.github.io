#Imagine

- John Lennon
- Adapted and updated version

Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today...

**
You may say we’re dreamers (say we’re dreamers)
But we’re not the only ones
Maybe someday you can join us
And the world could be as one
**

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
***Moving on their own…***

**
You may say we’re dreamers
But we’re not the only ones
Maybe someday you’ll join us
And the world will be as one
**

Imagine no possessions
We still wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of mankind
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world...

**
You may say we're a dreamers
But we're not the only ones
Maybe someday you will join us
And the world will live as one
**
